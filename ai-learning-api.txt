  Current Advantages vs Limitations

  ‚úÖ Strengths:
  - Alpaca provides 200 API calls/minute
  (vs Polygon's 5)
  - Real-time WebSocket data included free
  - Comprehensive US equity + crypto
  coverage
  - AI learning system already implemented
   and integrated

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
  - Limited to US markets (could add
  international via EODHD/Finnhub)
  - No commodities/forex (could add via
  Stooq/Finnhub)
  - Could benefit from additional
  sentiment sources

  Recommendation

  Your current Alpaca integration is
  excellent for 24/7 learning. To enhance
  the system, consider adding:

  1. Finnhub for international stocks and
  additional news sources
  2. EODHD for historical backtesting data
   to improve pattern recognition
  3. Styvio for fundamental data to
  enhance AI decision-making

  The bot is already capable of learning
  24/7 from all available Alpaca symbols
  (8,000+ stocks + crypto). Adding
  supplementary data sources would enhance
   learning quality but isn't necessary
  for core functionality.
