### 3. **Real-time Updates**
Orders automatically refresh every 30 seconds while bot is running.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **[components/dashboard/AITradingDashboard.tsx](components/dashboard/AITradingDashboard.tsx)**
  - Added live orders feed section (lines 709-806)
  - Added live trading indicator to header (lines 576-581)
  - Added aria-label to full orders table for navigation (line 851)

### Data Source
- Uses existing `useQuery` hook for Alpaca orders
- Shares same data as `LiveTradesDisplay` component
- No additional API calls - data is cached by React Query

### Update Frequency
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh on mount
- Instant updates when bot executes trades (via React Query cache invalidation)

## User Experience Flow

1. **User starts bot**
   - "Live Trading" badge appears in portfolio header
   - Orders feed shows "No recent orders" initially

2. **Bot executes first trade**
   - Order appears immediately in feed
   - Status shows as PENDING (yellow dot, pulsing)
   - Time stamp shows when order was placed

3. **Order fills**
   - Status updates to FILLED (green dot)
   - Shows filled quantity and average price
   - Time stamp updates to fill time

4. **More trades execute**
   - New orders appear at top
   - Feed shows 5 most recent
   - "View all X orders" button appears

5. **User wants details**
   - Clicks "View all orders →"
   - Page smoothly scrolls to full orders table
   - Can see complete order history with all details

## Mobile Responsive

The feed is fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Shows in portfolio card with full details
- **Tablet**: Adjusts spacing, maintains readability
- **Mobile**: Stacks vertically, touch-friendly tap targets

## Accessibility

- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Color-blind friendly status indicators (shapes + colors)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch-optimized for mobile (44px minimum tap targets)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Filter by status (Filled, Canceled, Pending)
2. Filter by side (Buy, Sell)
3. Show estimated P&L for each order
4. Click order to see full details modal
5. Expand/collapse for more/less orders
6. Export orders to CSV
7. Real-time WebSocket updates (currently 30s polling)
